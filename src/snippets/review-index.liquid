              <p><strong>I Couldn’t Believe the Results!</strong></p>
              <p>I was lucky enough to be able to test an iClean mini borrowed from my workplace. I couldn’t believe the results, my granite work tops are so smooth to the touch, and better still, my windows, which I have struggled to remove every smear from in the past, are now gleaming and smear free.</p>
              <p>It provides power that’s stronger than bleach but can even be used to spray on fruit and veg rather than washing them. I was completely sold, and immediately ordered one for my home.  I’ll not only be helping the planet but saving on all those many different cleaning products.</p>
               <p> I’ve been recommending the Mini to all my friends and family, so much so that they ask me if I’m on commission!  I’m not, of course, I’m simply passionate about its eco cleaning power and want to share this revolutionary product with everyone</p>
