      <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Safety</strong></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Remember children should never be left unattended in their highchair whilst feeding, regardless of weaning method and must be harnessed correctly according to the safety instructions of your highchair. BIBaDO is a smock, not a restraint.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">As parents ourselves we understand the importance of making sure products our children use are baby-safe. We have made sure from day one that BIBaDO complies with the most stringent international safety standards for baby weaning products. BIBaDO has passed international safety testing for the EU, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand; and is free from BPA, Phthalates and Azo-dyes. If you have any questions about the safety testing BIBaDO has been through please get in touch.</p>
